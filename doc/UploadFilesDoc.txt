	This executes the RSINDUpload.php program which then displays the "Upload a New RSIND file" page.

Repository:
	~/Automation/PMSUpload:
		Code:
			RSINDUpload.php (*)
				- Main user interface.  Serves the "Upload a New RSIND file" page and handles the files dropped
					onto this page.  
					(*) In order to be used by the web server it must be located in the web tree, so it must be
					copied to:
						public_html/pacmdev.org/points/RSINDUpload.php
					which, from the network point of view, is this URL:
						https://pacmdev.org/points/RSINDUpload.php
			ValidateNewRSINDFile.pl
				- Executed (by TestInstallRSIND.bash) to validate the uploaded RSIND file.  
					Errors will prevent the file from being distributed to its final destinations.
			GetMostRecentVersion.pl
				- Executed (by TestInstallRSIND.bash) to find the most recent file in a directory.  It is
					used to find the RSIND file being replaced by the one being uploaded.
			jqUpload/ (*)
				- this contains some public code used by RSINDUpload.php to support file dropping.
					(*) In order to be used by the web server this directory must be located in the web tree, so it must be
					copied to:
						public_html/pacmdev.org/points/jqUpload
					which, from the network point of view, is this URL:
						https://pacmdev.org/points/jqUpload
			Logs/
				This directory keeps a copy of all log files created.  Currently only ValidateNewRSINDFile.pl
				produces a log file.
			scripts/
				TestInstallRSIND.bash
					- exec'ed by RSINDUpload.php to do the following:
						: use ValidateNewRSINDFile.pl to validate the uploaded file
						: if no errors then distribute the uploaded file to its final destinations.
				GetMostRecentVersion.pl
					- used by TestInstallRSIND.bash to determine the most recent version of the installed RSIND file.
				
					
		UploadedFiles:
			RSIND/
				- uploaded files are uploaded to this location prior to validation and distribution
					to its final destinations.  If the files contain no errors (thus are distributed
					as necessary) they are left here so they can't be uploaded again.
		lib:
			DrupalBackup.txt  
				- A copy of the content of the 3 drupal pages.
			UploadSupport.php
				- Encryption/decryption support
		doc:
			various documents

Drupal Content:
	Log in and view the Content screen.  The following Basic pages are used for uploading files:
		Data Upload - explains the other two
		RSIND Upload - invoked if 'Admin > Admin Tasks > Data Upload > RSIND Upload' selected
		OW Results Upload - Invoked if 'Admin > Admin Tasks > Data Upload > OW Results' selected

All files uploaded are stored here:
	<web directory holding RSINDUpload.php>/UploadedFiles/
	In particular, all RSIND files are stored here:
		<web directory holding RSINDUpload.php>/UploadedFiles/RSIND
	and, if validation is OK, are distributed to its final destination: the AGSOTY and Open Water working directories:
		AGSOTY:
			this directory depends on the season.  For example, for the 2019 season:
			/usr/home/pacdev/Automation/PMSTopTen/SeasonData/Season-2019/PMSSwimmerData/
		Open Water:
			/usr/home/pacdev/Automation/PMSOWPoints/SourceData/PMSSwimmerData


What does the following mean?  The two files of the same name are slightly different.  Are they supposed to be?  If so, why?  If not then why do we have two copies?
Perl:
	~/Automation/PMSTopTen/Code/ValidateNewRSINDFile.pl - uses other perl modules.h
